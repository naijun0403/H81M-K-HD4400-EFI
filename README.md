# ⚠️ Not maintained!
I no longer use hardware in this configuration; the EFI is valid up to the version listed below, but I no longer plan to maintain it.

# H81M-K-HD4400-EFI
Hackintosh EFI for H81M-K and HD4400(It is OpenCore 0.7.0!)

# What is YEARS?
mac gen is 2015 Late

# Works it?
Yes It's good!

## is it Support BigSur?
It works, but the HD4400 is inevitably a bit unstable, so I can use it up to Catalina.
